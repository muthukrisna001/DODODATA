The dodo bird is one of the most famous examples of human-driven extinction:

About the Dodo

Scientific name: Raphus cucullatus

Habitat: Native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.

Appearance: A large, flightless bird (around 1 meter / 3.3 ft tall, weighing 10–18 kg), with a big hooked beak, stout body, short wings, and small, stubby tail.

Diet: Likely ate fruits, seeds, nuts, bulbs, and possibly small land animals.

Relatives: Belonged to the pigeon and dove family (Columbidae). Its closest living relative today is the Nicobar pigeon.

Why It Became Famous

The dodo lived peacefully on Mauritius with no natural predators, so it evolved without fear of humans or other large animals.

Because it couldn’t fly and wasn’t afraid of humans, it was an easy target for hunters.

Reasons for Extinction

The extinction happened within less than 100 years after humans discovered Mauritius (1598 → extinct by ~1662). Main causes:

Human hunting – Sailors and settlers killed dodos for food, though many reports say the meat wasn’t very tasty.

Introduced animals – Rats, pigs, monkeys, and dogs brought by humans raided dodo nests, eating eggs and chicks. Since dodos laid just one egg at a time, this devastated their population.

Habitat destruction – Forests were cut down for settlements and plantations, removing the dodo’s natural home.

Symbolism

The dodo became a global symbol of extinction and human impact on nature.

The phrase “as dead as a dodo” is still used to mean something completely gone.

Interestingly, scientists are now exploring the possibility of “de-extinction” using DNA from preserved remains, though that’s still in research stages.
