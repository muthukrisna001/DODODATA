# üé® DODODATA - Multi-Tool AI Web Application

## ü¶§ Why "DODO"?

The dodo bird is one of the most famous examples of human-driven extinction. This project is named DODODATA as a tribute to preserving knowledge and preventing the "extinction" of important information about technology and computing history.

### About the Dodo Bird
- **Scientific name**: Raphus cucullatus
- **Habitat**: Native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean
- **Appearance**: A large, flightless bird (around 1 meter / 3.3 ft tall, weighing 10‚Äì18 kg), with a big hooked beak, stout body, short wings, and small, stubby tail
- **Diet**: Likely ate fruits, seeds, nuts, bulbs, and possibly small land animals
- **Relatives**: Belonged to the pigeon and dove family (Columbidae). Its closest living relative today is the Nicobar pigeon

The dodo became a global symbol of extinction and human impact on nature. The phrase "as dead as a dodo" is still used to mean something completely gone. Interestingly, scientists are now exploring the possibility of "de-extinction" using DNA from preserved remains.

Just as we work to preserve endangered species, DODODATA works to preserve and share important knowledge about technology history while embracing cutting-edge AI innovations.
